                This report guides the reader through Australia current renewable energy landscape using maps and charts that show where 
                projects sit, how much capacity each state has, and how generation has changed over time. It is written for an average
                Australian with no prior technical background and uses simple explanations of terms where needed. A megawatt MW measures how 
                much power a site can produce at a single moment while a gigawatt hour GWh measures how much energy is produced over time for 
                example one GWh equals one thousand megawatt hours. The narrative begins with the map of major installations, then compares 
                states and technologies, highlights large projects, and ends with an analysis of long term generation trends.

                This map plots major renewable installations of 10 MW and larger across Australia and shows where different technologies are 
                concentrated. Points are sized by installed capacity in megawatts MW and coloured by the primary fuel such as solar, wind and 
                hydro so the map makes it easy to see both density and technology type. A megawatt MW is a common measure of generation capacity 
                and indicates how much power a site can produce at a moment in time. The map shows most large projects clustered along the 
                eastern and southeastern coast and on some regional corridors while more isolated projects appear in other states.

                        This stacked bar chart shows the total annual generation by state split into renewable and non renewable components so the reader can compare 
                        each state overall supply mix. The vertical axis reports energy produced in GWh which makes it easy to see which states produce the most energy 
                        and how much of that comes from renewables. Readers should look for states where the renewable portion forms a large share of total generation and 
                        for states where non renewable sources still dominate. Insert discussion about regional grid constraints and interstate transmission capacity here.

                        This stacked bar chart breaks each state total down by renewable technology such as solar, wind and hydro so the reader can see the technology 
                        mix behind each state total. The vertical axis shows energy in GWh which helps compare how much each technology actually produced during 2023 
                        24 rather than simply showing installed capacity. The chart highlights that some states rely heavily on wind while others show strong solar or 
                        hydro contributions and the annotations point out that South Australia is a large wind producer while Tasmania produces a large amount of renewable 
                        energy per person. Insert discussion about how seasonal patterns and storage affect annual output here.

                        The horizontal bar chart lists the 10 largest renewable power stations by installed capacity in MW 
                        and groups them by their primary fuel source. Installed capacity in MW measures how much power a plant 
                        can generate under optimal conditions rather than how much energy it generates over a year. This view 
                        helps identify the single largest projects and shows whether wind or solar dominate the top end of the 
                        market. Insert discussion about local community and grid integration impacts here.

                The area chart shows national energy generation by source from 2000 through 2024 and stacks each fuel so the 
                reader can see both totals and how the mix has changed. The large brown area indicates historical dominance by coal 
                while the rising bands of solar and wind toward the right show the growing contribution of renewable generation. 
                Battery and biofuel contributions are smaller but visible in recent years reflecting new technologies and deployments. 
                The vertical axis is energy in GWh so the reader can compare yearly energy production across sources.

                Over the last two decades the chart shows a clear decline in coal generation alongside steady increases in 
                wind and a rapid rise in solar generation especially after about 2015. Wind farms add consistent output 
                over many years while solar has grown quickly because of large utility farms and rooftop installations. 
                Battery storage appears as an emerging category and helps explain how variable renewables can be balanced 
                during peak times. Hydro remains a steady, seasonally variable contributor and helps to firm supply in some 
                regions.

                Taken together the trends suggest the electricity system is moving from a few large thermal plants toward 
                a more diverse mix that includes many renewable sites and increasing storage capacity. Continued growth of 
                renewables will require more grid upgrades, more storage to manage variability and new approaches to system 
                planning to keep supply reliable as old plants retire. This chart shows the direction of travel but not 
                detailed forecasts or the costs of transition so further analysis is needed to assess emissions pathways 
                and affordability. Insert discussion about forecasts, firming capacity needs and policy scenarios here.
