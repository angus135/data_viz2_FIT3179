                Australia stands at a critical point in its energy history. By the end of 2024, coal's share in electricity generation 
                dropped below 50% for the first time, a huge moment for a nation that has built its economy on fossil fuel exports. 
                This visualization maps the dimensions of Australia's renewable energy transition, 
                showing the progress made so far and the work that is yet to be done.

            <p class="standard-text">
                Two key measurements are important for this. A megawatt (MW) measures power capacity, how much 
                electricity a facility can generate. Compare this to a gigawatt-hour (GWh) which measures the actual energy production over a period of time, 
                this value describes what was actually delivered to homes and businesses. The distinction is important as a solar farm might have high MW capacity but 
                lower annual GWh output due to there being no electricity produced at night time or when the weather is poor.

                Australia's renewable installations of 10 MW and larger cluster dramatically along the eastern seaboard, reflecting both 
                population density and grid infrastructure that evolved over a century of centralized coal-fired generation. The concentration 
                exists because connecting renewable projects to the existing grid remains far more economically viable than building entirely 
                new transmission corridors to remote locations, even if there is an abundance of wind or solar elsewhere.
            <br></br></p>
            <p class="standard-text">
                Through the map the higher density of renewable projects (such as in the west of Victoria) reveals Australia's renewable energy zones.
                These are designated areas with strong resources and faster and easier planning approvals designed to accelerate development. 
                Despite these, progress remains uneven. In New South Wales, large renewable project approvals 
                take four to seven years and cost over $4 million, while Queensland's system takes just one to two years and costs $30,000. This 
                difference across states results in projects clustering in jurisdictions with faster approvals 
                rather than the best resource locations.

                        Total electricity generation reveals Australia's fundamental regional inequality. New South Wales and Queensland generate the
                        most energy simply because they have the largest populations and industrial bases, but their grids remain heavily dependent 
                        on aging coal plants.
                    <br></br></p>
                    <p class="standard-text">
                        Tasmania tells a completely different story. Nearly 100% renewable from hydro projects built decades ago. 
                        Compare this to South Australia which has transitioned from coal dependence to majority renewable generation 
                        within 15 years, now regularly operating at 70-80% of electricity being renewable. However, this wasn't without difficulty. The state 
                        experienced a statewide blackout in 2016 during the transition, teaching lessons about the transition process that the rest of 
                        Australia is now applying.
                    <br></br></p>
                    <p class="standard-text">
                        The interstate transmission constraints create problems in this data. South 
                        Australia often generates more renewable energy than it can use domestically but limits how much can flow to other 
                        states. Some solar farms experienced reduction rates of production above 25% in 2024, with generators literally 
                        switching off during midday peaks because the grid cannot absorb the power. Tasmania's massive hydro resources could help all 
                        the eastern state's variable renewables, but the proposed Marinus Link connecting it to Victoria faces many years of planning.
                    <br></br></p>
                    <p class="standard-text">
                        Western Australia is completely isolated from the eastern grid, making its transition unique. The state's  
                        geography and mining have increased solar installations, particularly in remote mining operations. Meanwhile, 
                        the Northern Territory, despite abundant solar resources and sparse population, remains the least developed in renewable infrastructure, 
                        presenting both a challenge and an opportunity for future growth.

            <p class="standard-text"><br></br>
                This treemap reveals the dramatic scale differences between renewable technologies and their geographic concentration. 
                Solar dominates by sheer number of installations across Queensland, New South Wales, and South Australia, while hydro's deep blue 
                blocks in Tasmania and the Snowy Hydro Scheme in New South Wales represent fewer but much larger individual projects.
            <br></br></p>
            <p class="standard-text">
                But this technology mix creates new challenges. Solar generation peaks in spring and summer afternoons then 
                disappears entirely overnight. Wind varies by weather patterns and seasons. Hydroelectricity depends on rainfall and dam 
                management, Tasmania's output can swing between wet and dry years. As at the end of 2024, there was over 8.7 GW/23.3 GWh 
                of large-scale battery capacity under construction, essential infrastructure for the transition to renewable will be to provide grid 
                stability that coal plants once delivered through their rotating mass.

                        scale converted fossil fuel plants like Liddell and Swanbank and the projects that make up the Snow Hydro Scheme, large wind 
                        farms dominate the top ranksâ€”projects. With MacIntyre (923 MW), Stockyard Hill (530 MW) and Coopers Gap (453 MW) representing 
                        investments of over $1 billion each and requiring years of development, community consultation, and grid connection studies before

                These mega-projects face intense scrutiny from local communities concerned about visual impact, noise, and property values. Unlike 
                coal plants that employed hundreds of permanent workers, large renewable installations typically need only a handful of ongoing 
                operations staff after construction, fundamentally changing regional employment patterns. Financial investment in large-scale renewable 
                generation projects skyrocketed by 500% in 2024, jumping from $1.5 billion in 2023 to $9 billion, but this money flows differently 
                through regional economies than the huge long-term industrial operations that coal mining and power generation represented.

                The bubble plot shows two decades of Australia's renewable energy transformation through the lens of individual power station installations. 
                The logarithmic scale reveals stark differences in project design philosophy across eras and technologies. Hydro-electric stations, clustered 
                densely around 2001 (when they were accreddited under new legislation), represent large-scale infrastructure with high installed capacity.
                These projects were designed to power cities by themselves and provide flexible power that can easily be turned on or off rather than constant 
                generation. Wind farms projects were the main source of the 2000s expansion, showing consistent, with consistent capacity-to-output ratios. 
                Then solar's explosion after 2015 fundamentally changed the renewable energy in Australia. Hundreds of 
                installations spanning from utility-scale solar farms to smaller distributed projects, many still ramping up to full production capacity as 
                indicated by their small areas.

                The area chart spanning 2000 to 2024 gives a view at Australia's energy transformation history. Coal's share fell from 64% a decade 
                ago to 46% in 2023, with the decline accelerating as plants reach end-of-life and become economically unviable compared to 
                renewables. The coal generation dominating the chart's early years represents not just electricity but part of Australia's industrial identity,
                the Hunter Valley and Latrobe Valley built entire communities around an industry now in terminal decline.
            <br></br></p>
            <p class="standard-text">
                Wind's steady climb from negligible in 2000 to major contributor by 2024 reflects the bipartisan Renewable Energy Target that provided 
                investment certainty through the 2010s. Solar's explosive surge after 2015 combines utility-scale farms at competitive prices with the world's 
                highest per-capita rooftop adoption (over 35% of Western Australian homes now have arrays). This distributed generation fundamentally changed 
                grid management, as power now flows not just from power stations but also from residential areas exporting significant electricity midday.
            <br></br></p>
            <p class="standard-text">
                The emergence of battery storage (too small to see but filter by Battery) represents the start of large-scale adoption and a critical turning 
                point for renewable reliability. While batteries contributed minimal electricity generation through 2023, $3.8 billion was invested in 2024 alone, 
                signaling large future growth. Tesla's Hornsdale Power Reserve in South Australia proved the concept in 2017, a 150 MW/194 MWh system that paid 
                for itself within three years by allowing the grid to be stabilised. This success created a pipeline of large projects: the 
                Victorian Big Battery (300 MW/450 MWh), Waratah Super Battery in NSW (850 MW/1,680 MWh under construction), and dozens of grid-scale installations 
                across all states. These batteries don't just store excess solar for evening use, they provide instant response to grid fluctuations that coal 
                plants physically cannot match, effectively replacing the rotational inertia that stabilized grids for a century. As battery costs continue falling 
                and installations scale up, this tiny sliver on the chart will expand rapidly, becoming the critical infrastructure that enables grids to operate 
                reliably at 80-100% renewable generation.

            <h2 class="section-title">Where To From Here?</h2>
            <p class="standard-text">
                The trajectory is clear but not inevitable. Achieving Australia's commitment of 82% renewable electricity by 2030 requires sustaining the 
                recent investment pace while solving transmission constraints, managing grid stability with greater renewables, and ensuring a fair 
                transitions for coal-dependent communities. The Australian government announced an additional funding of $1.2 billion for its 
                "green bank," aimed at accelerating the transition, recognizing that despite the progress, many challenges lie ahead. The 
                coal generation that remains is increasingly critical for system stability during periods of low renewable output, creating a complex 
                situation where too-early closures risk blackouts but delayed closures lock in emissions and slow the transition.
            <br></br></p>
            <p class="standard-text">
                Australia's energy transformation has progressed from impossible to inevitable in just two decades, but the final stretch, replacing the 
                last coal plants while maintaining reliability and affordability, will test both our technical capabilities and social cohesion.
