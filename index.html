                Australia stands at a <strong>critical point</strong> in its energy history. By the end of 2024, <span class="energy-coal">coal's</span> share in electricity generation 
                dropped below <strong>50%</strong> for the first time, a huge moment for a nation that has built its economy on <strong>fossil fuel exports</strong>. 
                This visualization maps the dimensions of Australia's renewable energy transition, 
                showing the progress made so far and the work that is yet to be done.
            <br></br></p>

            <p class="standard-text">
                Two key measurements are important for this. A <strong>megawatt (MW)</strong> measures power capacity, how much 
                electricity a facility can generate. Compare this to a <strong>gigawatt-hour (GWh)</strong> which measures the actual energy production over a period of time, 
                this value describes what was actually delivered to homes and businesses. The distinction is important as a <span class="energy-solar">solar</span> farm might have high MW capacity but 
                lower annual GWh output due to there being no electricity produced at night time or when the weather is poor.

                Australia's renewable installations of <strong>10 MW and larger</strong> cluster dramatically along the eastern seaboard, reflecting both 
                <strong>population density</strong> and <strong>grid infrastructure</strong> that evolved over a century of centralized <span class="energy-coal">coal</span>-fired generation. The concentration 
                exists because connecting renewable projects to the existing grid remains far more economically viable than building entirely 
                new transmission corridors to remote locations, even if there is an abundance of <span class="energy-wind">wind</span> or <span class="energy-solar">solar</span> elsewhere.
            <br></br></p>
            <p class="standard-text">
                Through the map the higher density of renewable projects (such as in the west of Victoria) reveals Australia's <strong>renewable energy zones</strong>.
                These are designated areas with strong resources and faster and easier planning approvals designed to accelerate development. 
                Despite these, progress remains uneven. In New South Wales, large renewable project approvals 
                take <strong>four to seven years</strong> and cost over <strong>$4 million</strong>, while Queensland's system takes just <strong>one to two years</strong> and costs <strong>$30,000</strong>. This 
                difference across states results in projects clustering in jurisdictions with faster approvals 
                rather than the best resource locations.

                        Total electricity generation reveals Australia's fundamental <strong>regional inequality</strong>. New South Wales and Queensland generate the
                        most energy simply because they have the largest populations and industrial bases, but their grids remain heavily dependent 
                        on aging <span class="energy-coal">coal</span> plants.
                    <br></br></p>
                    <p class="standard-text">
                        Tasmania tells a completely different story. <strong>Nearly 100% renewable</strong> from <span class="energy-hydro">hydro</span> projects built decades ago. 
                        Compare this to South Australia which has transitioned from <span class="energy-coal">coal</span> dependence to <strong>majority renewable generation</strong> 
                        within <strong>15 years</strong>, now regularly operating at <strong>70-80%</strong> of electricity being renewable. However, this wasn't without difficulty. The state 
                        experienced a <strong>statewide blackout in 2016</strong> during the transition, teaching lessons about the transition process that the rest of 
                        Australia is now applying.
                    <br></br></p>
                    <p class="standard-text">
                        The <strong>interstate transmission constraints</strong> create problems in this data. South 
                        Australia often generates more renewable energy than it can use domestically but limits how much can flow to other 
                        states. Some <span class="energy-solar">solar</span> farms experienced <strong>reduction rates of production above 25%</strong> in 2024, with generators literally 
                        switching off during midday peaks because the grid cannot absorb the power. Tasmania's massive <span class="energy-hydro">hydro</span> resources could help all 
                        the eastern state's variable renewables, but the proposed <strong>Marinus Link</strong> connecting it to Victoria faces many years of planning.
                    <br></br></p>
                    <p class="standard-text">
                        Western Australia is <strong>completely isolated</strong> from the eastern grid, making its transition unique. The state's  
                        geography and mining have increased <span class="energy-solar">solar</span> installations, particularly in remote mining operations. Meanwhile, 
                        the Northern Territory, despite abundant <span class="energy-solar">solar</span> resources and sparse population, remains the <strong>least developed</strong> in renewable infrastructure, 
                        presenting both a challenge and an opportunity for future growth.

                This treemap reveals the <strong>dramatic scale differences</strong> between renewable technologies and their geographic concentration. 
                <span class="energy-solar">Solar</span> dominates by sheer number of installations across Queensland, New South Wales, and South Australia, while <span class="energy-hydro">hydro's</span> deep blue

            <p class="standard-text">
                But this technology mix creates new challenges. <span class="energy-solar">Solar</span> generation peaks in spring and summer afternoons then 
                disappears entirely overnight. <span class="energy-wind">Wind</span> varies by weather patterns and seasons. <span class="energy-hydro">Hydroelectricity</span> depends on rainfall and dam 
                management, Tasmania's output can swing between wet and dry years. As at the end of 2024, there was over <strong>8.7 GW/23.3 GWh</strong> 
                of large-scale <span class="energy-battery">battery</span> capacity under construction, essential infrastructure for the transition to renewable will be to provide <strong>grid

                These <strong>mega-projects</strong> face intense scrutiny from local communities concerned about visual impact, noise, and property values. Unlike 
                <span class="energy-coal">coal</span> plants that employed hundreds of permanent workers, large renewable installations typically need only a handful of ongoing 
                operations staff after construction, fundamentally changing <strong>regional employment patterns</strong>. Financial investment in large-scale renewable 
                generation projects <strong>skyrocketed by 500%</strong> in 2024, jumping from <strong>$1.5 billion in 2023 to $9 billion</strong>, but this money flows differently

                The bubble plot shows <strong>two decades</strong> of Australia's renewable energy transformation through the lens of individual power station installations. 
                The <strong>logarithmic scale</strong> reveals stark differences in project design philosophy across eras and technologies. <span class="energy-hydro">Hydro-electric</span> stations, clustered 
                densely around 2001 (when they were accreddited under new legislation), represent large-scale infrastructure with high installed capacity.
                These projects were designed to power cities by themselves and provide <strong>flexible power</strong> that can easily be turned on or off rather than constant 
                generation. <span class="energy-wind">Wind</span> farms projects were the main source of the 2000s expansion, showing consistent, with consistent capacity-to-output ratios. 
                Then <span class="energy-solar">solar's</span> explosion after <strong>2015</strong> fundamentally changed the renewable energy in Australia. Hundreds of

                The area chart spanning <strong>2000 to 2024</strong> gives a view at Australia's energy transformation history. <span class="energy-coal">Coal's</span> share fell from <strong>64%</strong> a decade 
                ago to <strong>46% in 2023</strong>, with the decline accelerating as plants reach end-of-life and become economically unviable compared to 
                renewables. The <span class="energy-coal">coal</span> generation dominating the chart's early years represents not just electricity but part of Australia's <strong>industrial identity</strong>,
                the Hunter Valley and Latrobe Valley built entire communities around an industry now in <strong>terminal decline</strong>.

                <span class="energy-wind">Wind's</span> steady climb from negligible in 2000 to major contributor by 2024 reflects the bipartisan <strong>Renewable Energy Target</strong> that provided 
                investment certainty through the 2010s. <span class="energy-solar">Solar's</span> explosive surge after 2015 combines utility-scale farms at competitive prices with the <strong>world's 
                highest per-capita rooftop adoption</strong> (over <strong>35% of Western Australian homes</strong> now have arrays). This <strong>distributed generation</strong> fundamentally changed 
                grid management, as power now flows not just from power stations but also from residential areas exporting significant electricity midday.

                The emergence of <span class="energy-battery">battery</span> storage (too small to see but filter by <span class="energy-battery">Battery</span>) represents the start of large-scale adoption and a <strong>critical turning 
                point</strong> for renewable reliability. While <span class="energy-battery">batteries</span> contributed minimal electricity generation through 2023, <strong>$3.8 billion</strong> was invested in 2024 alone, 
                signaling large future growth. Tesla's <strong>Hornsdale Power Reserve</strong> in South Australia proved the concept in 2017, a <strong>150 MW/194 MWh system</strong> that paid 
                for itself within three years by allowing the grid to be stabilised. This success created a pipeline of large projects: the 
                <strong>Victorian Big Battery (300 MW/450 MWh)</strong>, <strong>Waratah Super Battery</strong> in NSW (850 MW/1,680 MWh under construction), and dozens of grid-scale installations 
                across all states. These <span class="energy-battery">batteries</span> don't just store excess <span class="energy-solar">solar</span> for evening use, they provide <strong>instant response</strong> to grid fluctuations that <span class="energy-coal">coal</span> 
                plants physically cannot match, effectively replacing the <strong>rotational inertia</strong> that stabilized grids for a century. As <span class="energy-battery">battery</span> costs continue falling 
                and installations scale up, this tiny sliver on the chart will expand rapidly, becoming the <strong>critical infrastructure</strong> that enables grids to operate 
                reliably at <strong>80-100% renewable generation</strong>.

            <p class="standard-text">
                The trajectory is clear but not inevitable. Achieving Australia's commitment of <strong>82% renewable electricity by 2030</strong> requires sustaining the 
                recent investment pace while solving <strong>transmission constraints</strong>, managing grid stability with greater renewables, and ensuring a <strong>fair 
                transitions</strong> for <span class="energy-coal">coal</span>-dependent communities. The Australian government announced an additional funding of <strong>$1.2 billion</strong> for its 
                "green bank," aimed at accelerating the transition, recognizing that despite the progress, many challenges lie ahead. The 
                <span class="energy-coal">coal</span> generation that remains is increasingly critical for system stability during periods of low renewable output, creating a <strong>complex 
                situation</strong> where too-early closures risk blackouts but delayed closures lock in emissions and slow the transition.
            <br></br></p>
            <p class="standard-text">
                Australia's energy transformation has progressed from <strong>impossible to inevitable</strong> in just two decades, but the final stretch, replacing the 
                last <span class="energy-coal">coal</span> plants while maintaining reliability and affordability, will test both our <strong>technical capabilities and social cohesion</strong>.
